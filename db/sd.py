def bidirectional_dijkstra(G, source, target, weight = 'weight', skipset=None):
    """Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths using bidirectional search.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node.

    target : node
       Ending node.

    weight: string, optional (default='weight')
       Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight

    skipset: set, optional (default=None)
        set of node IDs to skip

    Returns
    -------
    length : number
        Shortest path length.

    Returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
    The first dictionary stores distance from the source.
    The second stores the path from the source to that node.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G=nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> length,path=sd.bidirectional_dijkstra(G,0,4, skips)
    >>> print(length)
    4
    >>> print(path)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    In practice  bidirectional Dijkstra is much more than twice as fast as
    ordinary Dijkstra.

    Ordinary Dijkstra expands nodes in a sphere-like manner from the
    source. The radius of this sphere will eventually be the length
    of the shortest path. Bidirectional Dijkstra will expand nodes
    from both the source and the target, making two spheres of half
    this radius. Volume of the first sphere is pi*r*r while the
    others are 2*pi*r/2*r/2, making up half the volume.

    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if edge weights
    are negative or are floating point numbers
    (overflows and roundoff errors can cause problems).
